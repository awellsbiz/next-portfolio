Phases for the change:

Below is the ordered implementation plan (phases + commits) to integrate the finalized grid, tokens, and surface system. It adheres to all Architect and Implementation rules, preserves behavior, and avoids layout/visual changes until tokens and primitives are in place.

## Implementation Plan (Phases + Commits)

### Phase 1 — Baseline cleanup (JSX correctness & dead code only)
**Goal:** Safe cleanup with zero visual/layout change.  
**Commit(s):**
- `cleanup: fix JSX correctness and remove unused imports`
- `cleanup: remove dead markup or unused components (no behavior change)`

**Risk points:**  
- Removing “unused” code that is actually referenced dynamically.  
- JSX fixes that unintentionally alter DOM structure.

---

### Phase 2 — Token introduction (no visual changes)
**Goal:** Add tokens in a centralized place without using them yet.  
**Commit(s):**
- `chore: define color and surface CSS tokens per spec`
- `chore: define spacing and radius tokens per spec`

**Risk points:**  
- Introducing tokens in multiple places or per-component definitions (violates system).  
- Accidental usage of tokens before primitives are ready.

---

### Phase 3 — Primitive layer (Card + layout wrappers only, no adoption yet)
**Goal:** Introduce primitives that map directly to tokens; do not swap existing components yet.  
**Commit(s):**
- `feat: add Card primitive wired to surface tokens`
- `feat: add layout wrappers for grid + rail (not used yet)`

**Risk points:**  
- Primitive styles accidentally differ from current card visuals.  
- Wrapper defaults that impose layout changes implicitly.

---

### Phase 4 — Token adoption (swap raw values → tokens in place)
**Goal:** Replace inline colors/spacing/border values with tokens but keep layout the same.  
**Commit(s):**
- `refactor: replace inline colors with tokens (no layout change)`
- `refactor: replace spacing/radius values with tokens (no layout change)`

**Risk points:**  
- Missing a token mapping and introducing a new arbitrary value.  
- Token values not matching current visuals (causes visual drift).

---

### Phase 5 — Primitive adoption (component-by-component)
**Goal:** Swap existing card-like markup for the `Card` primitive with no visual change.  
**Commit(s):**
- `refactor: migrate About card to Card primitive`
- `refactor: migrate Experience card to Card primitive`
- `refactor: migrate Education card to Card primitive`
- (continue per component)

**Risk points:**  
- Card padding/radius not matching existing layout; causes subtle shifts.  
- Unintended DOM or accessibility changes.

---

### Phase 6 — Layout wrapper adoption (grid + rail)
**Goal:** Apply grid + rail wrappers without changing layout yet; keep same structure.  
**Commit(s):**
- `refactor: wrap primary bento area with grid wrapper`
- `refactor: wrap utility rail with rail wrapper`

**Risk points:**  
- Introducing grid/flex where it previously wasn’t used, altering flow.  
- Violating “rail ≠ grid” separation.

---

### Phase 7 — Grid spec enforcement (final alignment with spec)
**Goal:** Apply finalized grid dimensions and placements **only after** tokens + primitives are fully integrated.  
**Commit(s):**
- `refactor: apply primary grid column/row specs and placements`
- `refactor: apply utility rail sizing and spacing per spec`
- `refactor: enforce mobile single-column rules`

**Risk points:**  
- Any mismatch in spans or fractional placement from spec.  
- Mobile rules accidentally using grid or side-by-side content.

---

### Phase 8 — Final cleanup + validation
**Goal:** Remove legacy styling, ensure no drift, and validate invariants.  
**Commit(s):**
- `cleanup: remove deprecated layout/styles`
- `chore: verify no arbitrary values remain`

**Risk points:**  
- Removing styles still relied on by remaining components.  
- Missing a tokenized value causing regressions.
