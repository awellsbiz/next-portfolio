              <p className="text-center font font-semibold text-white"> As a full stack software engineer, I thrive in collaborative environments and have a passion for creative problem-solving. With a strong affinity for Next.js, React, Django REST Framework, and PostgreSQL databases, I am confident in my skills in building robust and scalable web applications. Currently transitioning from the restaurant industry as a bartender, I am eager to immerse myself in the dynamic world of technology. Relocating from Springfield, MA to Los Angeles, CA after high school to pursue a filmmaking career, I have always embraced challenges and pursued opportunities for growth‚Ä¶And Working in restaurants-paid the bills. The instability of the film industry has motivated me to redirect my passion for learning, problem-solving, and technology toward a career in software engineering. My work in the filmmaking world and  restaurants combined has equipped me with strong skills in organization, leading, creative problem-solving, and a strong work-ethic.
